This is the first public release of the code. It consists of three main modules: *CUPRAD*, *CTDSE*, and *Hankel*. The modules are supplemented by Jupyter tutorials and other processing tools, such as example SLURM/PBS pipelines for running the code on an HPC cluster, and an environment for building a Docker image.

* **CUPRAD** This module computes nonlinear IR laser-pulse propagation. It solves the unidirectional pulse propagation equation for a linearly polarised field in cylindrical geometry.
* **CTDSE** This module solves the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation to obtain the microscopic response of a single atom. It is compiled into a parallel application (part of the main computational pipeline) and a dynamic library accessible through a Pythonic interface.
* **Hankel** This module solves a Hankel-like diffraction integral to propagate the XUV field. It is both part of the main computational pipeline and accessible independently as a Pythonic package, adaptable to various inputs.
